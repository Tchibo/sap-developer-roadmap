The ABAP Platform consists of three layers:
- UI Layer for frontend interactions with user (Fiori Apps, Web Dynpro, SAP GUI, WebUI, ...)
- Application Layer which provides business logic 
- Database Layer for persistency (SAP HANA, Oracle, ASE, ...).

The UI layer and database layer are part of separate roadmaps, therefore here only the functionalities of the application layer will be explained further.

There are different services that will be described afterwards which either belong to 
- a normal application server ABAP instance or to 
- the ABAP Server Central Services instance (only one per system).
