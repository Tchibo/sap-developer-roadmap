This component enables you to manage your database using the Computing Center Management System (CCMS). CCMS gives extensive support when scheduling and managing background jobs.

With background processing in CCMS you can
- configure and monitor the background processing system.
- schedule and manage a background job.

Background processing lets you move long-running or resource-intensive program runs to times when the system load is low. Also the dialog work processes are not lowered by job processing. 

SAP offers a wide variety to schedule programs as steps within entire job chains and let you create periodically repeats of these jobs.

### Usage
While its certainly comfortable to schedule jobs within SAP, most corporations have external job control tools. These should be taken into account when scheduling new jobs, so that the already established job control and job monitoring by tools like Automic is used.
