The RFC gateway carries out RFC services based onÂ TCP/IP. These services enable SAP systems and external programs to communicate with one another. (See Connectivity / RFC) Each application server instance of an ABAP system contains an RFC gateway. 

### Gateway Processes
The RFC gateway consists of the following processes:

- Gateway:
        The gateway process is started by the dispatcher and checked by this periodically. All RFC requests are received and processed by the gateway process.
- Gateway Monitor
        The gateway monitor is used for analysis and administration of the SAP Gateway. You can monitor the gateway with transaction SMGW.
