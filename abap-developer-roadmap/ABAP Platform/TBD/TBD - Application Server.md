The ABAP application server is the core execution engine for ABAP code. It manages the processing of business logic, handles communication between components, and ensures transactional consistency. Key capabilities include:

- Lifecycle management for ABAP programs and classes
- Built-in transaction control and session management
- Integrated security, authorization, and identity services
- Background job scheduling and execution

## Runtime Environment and Development Tools

ABAP runs on a virtual machine within the ABAP application server, optimized for executing compiled ABAP code efficiently. The platform is deeply integrated with **SAP HANA**, enabling:

- Code pushdown to the database via ABAP SQL and CDS views
- Optimized performance through native HANA execution
- In-memory processing for real-time analytics and transactional workloads

The platform supports development through **ABAP Development Tools (ADT)** in Eclipse, offering a modern IDE for managing data models, services, classes, and UIs.

## Platform Services and Features

The ABAP Platform provides a broad set of capabilities to support modern development:

- **Core Data Services (CDS)** for data abstraction and modeling
- **RESTful ABAP Programming Model (RAP)** for service-oriented, UI-ready application logic
- **Fiori Elements** integration for UI generation
- **Extensibility** mechanisms to customize SAP applications without modifying the core
- **Lifecycle Management** tools for versioning, deployment, and transport
