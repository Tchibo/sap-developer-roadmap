SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform and an innovative relational database management system that can be used both on-premise and on-demand. It optimises the use of current hardware to increase performance and reduce costs and opens up new application scenarios. Developers can use SAP HANA to create applications that efficiently integrate the business logic and database layer by minimising data movement and working directly in memory to achieve optimal performance.
