Window expressions are advanced ABAP SQL functions designed for sophisticated calculations. They execute additional queries within defined subsets of the main result set - known as "windows".

Each window expression consists of two main parts: a function (such as rank, sum, or average) and a window definition using `OVER ( )`. Inside the window definition, you can specify how to group your data using `PARTITION BY`or set the order for processing records with `ORDER BY`.

Window expressions also include functions to look at neighboring records - you can grab data from the previous entry using `LEAD( )` or the next entry using `LAST( )`.
### Usage
While window functions enable sophisticated data analysis that would be difficult to achieve otherwise, they should be used sparingly. They make your code more complex and harder to troubleshoot. Only use them when simpler approaches won't work.

```SQL
SELECT  Product,
		CreationDate,
		LEAD( CreationDate ) 
			OVER( PARTITION BY Division ORDER BY CreationDate ) as LastProductCreation,
		DAYS_BETWEEN( CreationDATE, 
					  LEAD( CreationDate ) 
						  OVER( PARTITION BY Division ORDER BY CreationDate ) 
		) as DaysSinceLastProductCreation
FROM I_Product
```
