In ABAP 7.4 and higher, there are numerous innovations in the field of **ABAP SQL**. Below are the most important changes regarding the given topics:

- **SQL Window Function (Rank and Value):**
    - ABAP now supports **window functions** like `RANK()`, which allow you to calculate rankings over partitions of a result set. This is useful for determining sequences and value comparisons directly in SQL
    - 
- **SQL Window Expression:**
    - Window expressions enable the use of calculated values over a defined window group (using `OVER(...)`), such as totals, averages, or running sums over subsets of a result set. This allows analytical evaluations to be performed directly in SQL, without additional ABAP 
    - 
- **SQL Window Expression with Frames:**
    - The definition of so-called **frames** allows even more detailed control over which subset of a partition a window function is applied to. For example, you can explicitly specify the range of rows that should be included in the calculation (e.g., the last n rows)
    - 
- **ABAP SQL Aggregate Queries and For All Entries:**
    - Aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT` have been enhanced. They can now be used more efficiently in combination with other SQL features like `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. In addition, the interaction with **FOR ALL ENTRIES** has been significantly improvedwww.reverso.n
- **Open SQL Enhancements:**
    
    - **New SQL keywords** like `CASE`, `CAST`, and extended arithmetic operations are now directly available in Open SQL.
    - **JOINs have been improved:** There is now support for different join types (e.g., RIGHT OUTER JOIN).
    - **UNION/UNION ALL** is also possible, allowing multiple result sets to be combinedwww.translate.com.
    - Host variables must be introduced with `@` from 7.4 onwards.
- **Expressions & Operations in CDS Views:**
    
    - CDS views now offer more **expression possibilities**, such as arithmetic calculations, string operations, and comparison operators directly in the view.
- **Inline Data Declarations:**
    
    - With `@DATA` and `@TABLE`, variables and internal tables can be defined directly when using the SELECT statement, resulting in more compact and clearer code.
- **Read Internal Tables with New Syntax:**
    
    - New language elements now allow more convenient and performant access to internal tables, such as new reading and filtering options.
- **Indicator Structures:**
    
    - Introduction of **indicator structures** for efficiently managing meta-information or status indicators for data records.
