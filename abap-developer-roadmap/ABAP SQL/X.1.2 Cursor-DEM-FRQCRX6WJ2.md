In **ABAP SQL**, a **cursor** is a database object used to process data **row by row** rather than as a complete set. This mechanism is especially useful when you need to handle each row individually, such as for custom logic or complex operations that cannot be performed in a single SQL statementwww.learnsapabap.comwww.geeksforgeeks.org[4].

**Purpose of Cursor in ABAP SQL:**

- **Manages result sets row by row:** A cursor allows you to fetch, process, and manipulate query results one row at a timewww.learnsapabap.comwww.geeksforgeeks.org.
- **Necessary for procedural or conditional logic:** When an operation requires processing each record individually (for example, applying conditions or calculations per row), a cursor is used to sequentially access each row and perform the desired logicwww.learnsapabap.comwww.geeksforgeeks.org.
- **Controls data flow:** It gives developers more precise control over how data is retrieved and manipulated, which is otherwise challenging with set-based SQL operationswww.geeksforgeeks.org.
- **Iterative processing:** Especially when you need to loop through datasets, transform fields, or handle records that can't be processed effectively in bulkwww.learnsapabap.comwww.geeksforgeeks.org[4].

> "A cursor is a database object which is used to manipulate data in a set of row by row. We can say that a cursor is a set of rows with a pointer and this pointer actually points to the current row.

**Workflow in ABAP SQL:**

1. **Declare the cursor** with the desired SQL SELECT statement.
2. **Open the cursor** to link it to the result set of the query.
3. **Fetch rows** one at a time (or in blocks) for processing.
4. **Close the cursor** when done to release resourceswww.learnsapabap.com.

**Note:** Although cursors are powerful, they can impact performance due to their row-by-row nature. It's generally recommended to use set-based operations whenever possible, utilizing cursors only when absolutely necessary for granular, row-level logicwww.learnsapabap.comwww.geeksforgeeks.org.

In summary, **cursors in ABAP SQL** enable row-wise data manipulation and are fundamental for cases where set-based processing is insufficient. Key concepts include declaration, opening, fetching, and closing operations, all centered around
