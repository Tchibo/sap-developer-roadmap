In **ABAP SQL**, a **cursor** is a database object used to process data **row by row** rather than as a complete set. This mechanism is especially useful when you need to handle each row individually, such as for custom logic or complex operations that cannot be performed in a single SQL statement.

**Purpose of Cursor in ABAP SQL:**
- **Manages result sets row by row:** A cursor allows you to fetch, process, and manipulate query results one row at a time.

- **Necessary for procedural or conditional logic:** When an operation requires processing each record individually (for example, applying conditions or calculations per row), a cursor is used to sequentially access each row and perform the desired logic.

- **Controls data flow:** It gives developers more precise control over how data is retrieved and manipulated, which is otherwise challenging with set-based SQL operations.

- **Iterative processing:** Especially when you need to loop through datasets, transform fields, or handle records that can't be processed effectively in bulk

**Workflow in ABAP SQL:**

1. **Declare the cursor** with the desired SQL SELECT statement.
2. **Open the cursor** to link it to the result set of the query.
3. **Fetch rows** one at a time (or in blocks) for processing.
4. **Close the cursor** when done to release resources
