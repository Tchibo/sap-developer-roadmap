**What is a Cursor?** Think of a cursor like a bookmark in a very large book. Instead of reading the entire book at once (which would be overwhelming), you read it page by page, keeping track of where you are with your bookmark.

**How it Works:**
```
" 1. Open the cursor (place your bookmark)
OPEN CURSOR @cursor FOR SELECT * FROM huge_table WHERE...

" 2. Read data in chunks (read a few pages at a time)
DO.
  FETCH NEXT CURSOR @cursor INTO TABLE @lt_data PACKAGE SIZE 1000.
  IF sy-subrc <> 0.
    EXIT. " No more data (reached the end of the book)
  ENDIF.
  
  " Process your 1000 records here
  LOOP AT lt_data INTO ls_data.
    " Do something with each record
  ENDLOOP.
ENDDO.

" 3. Close the cursor (remove your bookmark)
CLOSE CURSOR @cursor.
```
**Why Use Cursors?**

- **Memory Management**: Instead of loading 1 million records into memory at once (which could crash your program), you process 1000 at a time
- **Performance**: Your program stays responsive and doesn't consume excessive resources
- **Large Data Processing**: Essential when dealing with tables containing millions of records

**Real-World Analogy:** It's like eating a large pizza - you don't stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once. You take manageable bites (package size), chew and swallow (process), then take the next bite.

**Key Points:**

- Always CLOSE your cursor when done (like closing a file)
- Choose appropriate package size (usually 1000-10000 records)
- Perfect for batch processing jobs that handle massive datasets

In **ABAP SQL**, a **cursor** is a database object used to process data **row by row** rather than as a complete set. This mechanism is especially useful when you need to handle each row individually, such as for custom logic or complex operations that cannot be performed in a single SQL statement.

**Purpose of Cursor in ABAP SQL:**
- **Manages result sets row by row:** A cursor allows you to fetch, process, and manipulate query results one row at a time.

- **Necessary for procedural or conditional logic:** When an operation requires processing each record individually (for example, applying conditions or calculations per row), a cursor is used to sequentially access each row and perform the desired logic.

- **Controls data flow:** It gives developers more precise control over how data is retrieved and manipulated, which is otherwise challenging with set-based SQL operations.

- **Iterative processing:** Especially when you need to loop through datasets, transform fields, or handle records that can't be processed effectively in bulk

**Workflow in ABAP SQL:**

1. **Declare the cursor** with the desired SQL SELECT statement.
2. **Open the cursor** to link it to the result set of the query.
3. **Fetch rows** one at a time (or in blocks) for processing.
4. **Close the cursor** when done to release resources
