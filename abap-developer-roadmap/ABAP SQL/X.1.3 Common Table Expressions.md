**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** in **ABAP SQL** are temporary, named result sets that can be used within a SQL statement to make complex queries more readable and efficient. In ABAP SQL, CTEs are defined using the **WITH** keyword.

**Key features and benefits:**
- A **CTE** creates a **temporary result set** (similar to a temporary view) that exists only for the duration of the query and can be referenced within the same statement.
- **CTEs improve readability** and maintainability, especially when intermediate results are needed multiple times or when dealing with complex data manipulations.
- With CTEs, **you can structure subqueries** and use them directly as data sources in the main query. Previously, in ABAP SQL, you couldn't directly select from a subquery.
- CTEs are always executed directly in the database and do **not use table buffering.
- The scope of a CTE is **limited to the individual query**; it is not available outside that query.

**Practical use cases:**
- Using **intermediate results** in complex queries without writing multiple nested SELECT statements.
- **Reusing the same query logic** multiple times in a SELECT statement without duplication.
- Improving **performance and clarity** for queries requiring multiple processing steps.
