SAP Business Workflow is an integral component within SAP systems, designed to automate and streamline business processes. It empowers users to define, execute, and monitor workflows ranging from simple approval chains to complex business scenarios. With SAP Business Workflow, organizations can enhance productivity by reducing manual effort and ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently.

SAP is not investing heavily in new business workflow features, but is instead focusing on newer solutions. Existing SAP Business Workflow implementations can be retained, but migration to modern alternatives should be planned.
