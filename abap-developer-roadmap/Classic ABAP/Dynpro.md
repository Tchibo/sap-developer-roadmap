## Importance of Dynpro
Dynpros are an old technology for user interfaces that should no longer be relevant today.  Nowadays, user interfaces should be implemented exclusively via SAP Fiori.

ABAP Dynpro, short for Dynamic Programming, was indispensable in SAP systems for creating user interfaces. It formed the basis for creating interactive screens within SAP applications.
### Key components
1. **Screen**: The interface through which user interaction took place, consisting of fields, buttons, and tables.

2. **Flow logic**: Programming related to screen events, divided into PBO (Process Before Output) and PAI (Process After Input). PBO prepared data for display, while PAI processed user input.

3. **Screen elements**: Components such as input and output fields that enabled the entry and display of user data.

4. **Modules**: Individual subroutines for performing tasks during PBO or PAI, such as data processing or validation.

5. **GUI status and titles**: Elements that controlled the screen layout and user commands via menus and toolbars, improving usability.
