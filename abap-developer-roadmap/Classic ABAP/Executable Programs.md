#Basic 	
Reports in SAP ABAP are instrumental for data processing and information delivery. They facilitate effective decision-making by presenting large amounts of data in a structured format. Understanding how to create and manage reports is crucial for SAP ABAP developers, as it enables them to provide valuable insights to business users.

Nowadays, reports are being replaced by the Fiori List Report Floorplan as a modern alternative.

## Types of Reports
1. **Classic Reports**: These are simple reports displaying data in a columnar format. They are easy to develop and are often used for straightforward information presentation.
   
2. **ALV (ABAP List Viewer) Reports**: ALV reports offer advanced features such as sorting, filtering, and interactive elements, making them highly versatile for complex data analysis.

## Concepts and Tools
- **Selection Screens**: Selection screens allow users to input parameters, filter data, and refine the data fetching process before the report execution.

- **Event Blocks**: Familiarize yourself with key event blocks such as `START-OF-SELECTION`, `END-OF-SELECTION`, and `AT SELECTION-SCREEN`.

- **Data Retrieval**: Master techniques for retrieving data from database tables using Open SQL. Optimized data retrieval ensures reports run efficiently.
