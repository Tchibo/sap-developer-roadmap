#Basic 
SAP ABAP Knowledge Transfer Documents (KTDs) are SAP repository artifacts for structured documentation of ABAP development objects, including those introduced with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). KTDs are written in Markdown. They extend ABAP Doc to cover RAP-centric technologies and object types.

KTDs capture architectural decisions, implementation details, and best practices at the source, supporting knowledge retention and transfer across teams. This streamlines onboarding, improves maintainability, and reduces the risk of information loss during staffing changes or handovers.

Stored in the ABAP repository, KTDs are versioned, transportable, and part of the standard Dev-Test-Prod lifecycle. Directly linked to their source objects and editable in the same tools (e.g., ADT), they are maintained alongside code changes during refactoring, reviews, and releases, keeping documentation and implementation aligned.

Supported object types:

- CDS Data Definitions (DDL sources; e.g., view entities and projections)
- CDS Access Controls (DCL)
- CDS Metadata Extensions (MDE)
- RAP Behavior Definitions (BDEF)
- RAP Behavior Projections (BPR)
- Service Definitions (SRVD)
- Service Bindings (SRVB, e.g., OData V4)
- Event Consumption Models (ECM; AsyncAPI-based)
