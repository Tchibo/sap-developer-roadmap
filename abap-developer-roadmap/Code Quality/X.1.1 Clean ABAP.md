#Basic 
Clean ABAP is a practical guide that strengthens readability, simplicity, and testability, leading to consistent standards, easier maintenance, faster reviews, and fewer defects. As a result, solutions become more stable and upgrade-ready (e.g., toward S/4HANA/RAP), and teams work more efficiently. At the same time, Clean ABAP isn’t dogma: in some cases, teams deliberately deviate from the rules to meet business directives, regulatory requirements, or hard constraints. It’s important to justify such deviations transparently and actively manage the associated risks.

Clean ABAP is a voluntary, community-driven style and design guide at the code level (readability, testability, naming, small methods, exceptions instead of SY-SUBRC). SAP guidelines are product- and release-bound, partly mandatory rules at the architecture and compliance level (Clean Core, extensibility/RAP, security, performance, released APIs).
