Automated code quality tools increase reliability, consistency, and development speed, reduce human routine errors, and shift reviews from style issues to business logic. 
ATC serves as a central quality gate, enforcing mandatory rules for correctness, security, performance, and cloud compliance. As a result, small, low-risk changes can be transported without a separate two-person approval, saving time and labor costs. 
ABAP Cleaner standardizes style and syntax according to Clean ABAP, removes superfluous code, and modernizes language constructs without changing semantics. This shortens code reviews, reduces formatting debates, and makes onboarding and maintenance easier. 
Together, ATC and ABAP Cleaner complement each other: ATC ensures technical and regulatory quality, while the Cleaner ensures readability and consistency. The result is fewer defects, faster releases, and reviews that focus on business logic; high-risk changes are still reviewed with focused scrutiny.
