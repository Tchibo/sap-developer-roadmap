#Intermediate 
ABAP Cleaner is an ADT/Eclipse plugin that uses over 95 rules to automatically format and align ABAP code, modernize obsolete constructs, and reduce unnecessary nesting for clean, readable code. It is used interactively in the editor. You can preview changes beforehand and deselect them if needed. The rules are configurable and can be shared as team profiles, which can be tailored to corporate guidelines and help the team produce consistent results. Another benefit is that changes are consistent, and smaller refactorings take developers less time.
