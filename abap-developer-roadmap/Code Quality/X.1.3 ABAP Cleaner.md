#Intermediate 
ABAP Cleaner standardizes style and syntax in line with Clean ABAP and removes redundant code without changing semantics. This reduces formatting debates and makes onboarding and maintenance easier.

ABAP Cleaner is an ADT/Eclipse plug-in with more than 95 rules that automatically formats and aligns ABAP code, replaces obsolete constructs with modern alternatives, and reduces unnecessary nesting for clean, readable code. It is used interactively in the editor; you can preview changes beforehand and deselect them if needed. The rules are configurable and can be shared as team profiles that align with corporate guidelines and ensure consistent results. This saves time on reviews and minor refactorings.

Either through sharing [your wiki article](https://wiki.tchibo-intranet.de/x/YQfoNQ) or by spelling it out here. The 'tchibo defaults' config file on sharepoint returns a 404 btw.
