#Basic 
Documentation for ABAP developers serves several purposes. It clarifies what the code does and why design decisions were made, aiding maintenance, debugging, and future changes, especially in complex SAP systems. Good documentation lets others manage and understand code beyond the original author. It also supports smoother module integration and aligns development with business goals. This shared understanding reduces onboarding time, lowers risk during handovers, and supports continuous improvement initiatives across teams and projects. It also improves traceability of decisions and compliance with external auditing or regulatory requirements.

In long‑lived SAP applications, external documentation systems prove unsuitable. Keeping program and documentation in sync is the main challenge: docs written during implementation are only partly updated after later changes. Over a system’s lifecycle, wikis are replaced for economic reasons; painstakingly created content often can’t be migrated because of incompatibilities, and fully recreating it isn’t viable. The same holds for file‑based documentation, which must be continually synchronized, and whose formats have limited lifespans.

It’s therefore sensible to keep documentation close to the system—for example, ABAP Doc in code and ABAP Knowledge Transfer Documents as repository artifacts. The advantage: anyone with system access also has current, versioned documentation.
