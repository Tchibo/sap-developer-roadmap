#Basic 
SAP ABAP Knowledge Transfer Documents (KTDs) are a specialized SAP technology designed for the structured documentation of ABAP development objects, particularly focusing on the newer object types introduced with the ABAP Restful Application Programming Model (RAP). These document types are a progression beyond SAPScript-based documentation and ABAP Doc comments, especially for technologies and object types central to RAP.

KTDs serve the broader purpose of knowledge retention and transfer within SAP development teams, ensuring that critical architectural decisions, implementation details, and best practices are documented at the source. This facilitates onboarding, improves code maintainability, and prevents critical information loss when team members move or projects are handed over.

Storing the KTDs in the ABAP repository also ensures their long-term availability: they are version-managed, transportable and part of the regular lifecycle management (Dev → Test → Prod) so that they are not lost during the project runtime or during system copies. Due to their proximity to the respective source object - as directly assigned repository artifacts - they are automatically taken into account when changes are made to the object and can be maintained together in the same working context (e.g. in ADT). This promotes consistent updates in the course of refactorings, code reviews and releases and ensures that documentation and implementation remain permanently synchronized.
