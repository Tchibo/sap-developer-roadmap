The need of a software application to communicate with a wide range of different system environments demands leveraging different technologies. While communication in the past relied on proprietary ABAP system or file driven communication, it now focuses on internet-based methods using standard web technologies like XML, HTTPS, and SOAP.

SAP therefore supports a wide range of integration technologies that vary in age, are applicable to different scenarios, and present different benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore as SAP is a standard software, there is a large number of available standard interfaces that can be used to interact with SAP business objects.

Therefore this chapter has a clear focus on the use of standard technologies where either no implementation is needed or tries to point to recommended technologies and frameworks that should be used.

Starting with standard API's the SAP API Hub lists all available API's that can be used in order to exchange data:
- SOAP
- OData v2 & v4
- REST
- Business Events
- Business Object Interfaces (CRUD)
- CDS (GET via Graph)
