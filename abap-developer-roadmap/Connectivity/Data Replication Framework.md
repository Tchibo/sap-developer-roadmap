The Data Replication Framework (DRF) provides the ability to replicate most of the business objects and there assignments by the use of standard content.

The outbound implementation defines basically the business object the will be distributed as well as the used communication channel and the target system. Additional parameters can be applied for parallelization or language dependency of the distribution. 

Either a complete full load of an object can be sent, e.g. for customizing, or based on existing change triggers a delta can be identified and distributed.

### Usage
DRF should be used in distribution scenarios, where standard business objects needs to be distributed and standard technologies for distributions are available. These applies for IDocs as well as SOAP Services, the options RFC and File should be avoided.

It should also be mentioned that the replication does not react to an event / change pointer at a precise point in time, but starts via a scheduled job and is therefore more suitable for integration requirements that do not require the provision of data at a precise point in time such as master data.
