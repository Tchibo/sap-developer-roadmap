Destinations are the construct where endpoints as well as authentication information are stored or referenced. Typically this is done via transaction `SM59`, which is widely used within SAP.
The following destination types can be administered here

- HTTP Destinations 
- RFC / ABAP Destinations
- registered Server Programs
- Channel endpoints 

The main transaction for the destination administration is the `SM59`. Here you can maintain endpoints as well as authentication information for the endpoints. Still there are other ways to store destinations which might also reference back to the `SM59`.
##### Other Transactions
`SOAMANAGER` is used to maintain endpoints as well as authorization information for SOAP services. `OA2C_CONFIG` is used to maintain oAuth configurations in order to be used for authorization usage during data exchange.
