Destinations are the construct where endpoints as well as authentication information are stored or referenced. Typically this is done via transaction SM59 which is widely used within SAP.
The following destination types can be administered here
- HTTP Destinations 
- RFC / ABAP Destinations
- registered Server Programs

While SM59 Destinations are widely used within SAP, there are other ways to store destinations for other technologies. For example, destinations and authentication settings for SOAP services are maintained via SOAMANAGER.
