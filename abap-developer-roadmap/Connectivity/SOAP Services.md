SOAP web services use the SOAP protocol for standardized, XML-based data exchange via HTTP/HTTPS and enable the integration of SAP with other systems via WSDL definitions. WSDL files are generated by the provider of the web services and are imported by the consumer. 

The WSDL (Web Services Description Language) describes the used data types as well as the methods that can be used for requesting data. When the provider changes the web service, the WSDL must be updated, and all consumers must update their WSDL and adapt their clients accordingly.
### Usage
SOAP web services should be used only asynchronous and when they are provided by SAP for the use case of asynchronous data provisioning either outbound or inbound to SAP.
