#Basic 
Core Data Services (CDS) allow to define and consume semantically rich data models for use in business applications, forming the backbone of contemporary ABAP development. 

CDS view entities function as an abstraction layer above database tables, enabling developers to define virtual data models declaratively using the **Data Definition Language (DDL)**. CRUD access to the persistence of CDS view entities is automatically handled by the system by means of the **Service Adaptation Definition Language (SADL)**. Data access to CDS view entities is secured by means of roles defined in **Data Control Language (DCL)**. In the context of the RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) you can use the CDS Behaviour Definition Language (BDL) to define transactional behaviour for view entities to allow for modifying operations. 

CDS view entities leverage **annotations** to enhance virtual data models semantically for user interface configuration, analytics, search operations and OData exposure, thus optimizing data access and presentation. 

Within the ABAP environment, CDS view entities are fully integrated, capable of being consumed like database tables via ABAP SQL and supporting the addition of custom fields in key user and developer extensibility. 

CDS view entities are prominently used within the RAP model for the implementation and projection of business objects.
