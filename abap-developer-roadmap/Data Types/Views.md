A view combines data of different database tables. They can be used to display or edit data. 
The view type that is still most commonly used today is the **maintenance view**. It can be used to quickly provide a GUI user interface for maintaining data. Maintenance views can be grouped and hierarchically arranged in a view cluster.
Views are mostly outdated. They were replaced by **ABAP CDS Entities**, which are much more powerful and are well integrated in modern ABAP frameworks. Maintenance views are being replaced by **RAP Business Configuration Objects** as well.
