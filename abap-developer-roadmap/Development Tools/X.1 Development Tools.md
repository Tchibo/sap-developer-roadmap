#Basic 
In the SAP world, there is the old and the new world of development tools.


More and more familiar tools are being used. Eclipse plays a central role in ABAP development and Build Code in cloud development. This helps non-SAP developers to familiarise themselves with the processes more quickly. Especially the ABAP Development Tools allow developers to manage connections to multiple systems, customize their development experience to their specific needs and increase their productivity. Plugins for the development environment, such as ABAP Cleaner and Code Pal, are only possible in ADT.

The still-existing SAP Developer Workbench (SE80) is obsolete. It was the central tool for ABAP development and available directly in SAP GUI. Its functionality is far surpassed by the ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse, the only remaining part of SE80 that is still used in on-premise systems today is the "New ABAP Debugger" which still has some features that are not matched by the ADT Debugger.
