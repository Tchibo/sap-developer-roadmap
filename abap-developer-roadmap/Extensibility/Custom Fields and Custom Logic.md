SAP S/4HANA Key User Extensibility allows business users to enhance S/4HANA without requiring technical expertise or development skills. A feature of key user extensibility are the 'Custom Fields' Fiori app for creating custom fields and the 'Custom Logic' Fiori app for adding custom business logic. 

The **Custom Fields** app allows users to define new fields for various business contexts, integrating them into existing UIs and APIs. This allows for capturing data that is unique to a businessâ€™s operations. In S/4HANA and for available business contexts, field extensions are done in the Custom Fields app and no longer in the ABAP Dictionary using APPEND Structures.

The **Custom Logic** app allows users to define custom logic directly within the app. With this users can modify system behavior by implementing custom validations and actions while maintaining best practices in system integrity and performance. This is ensured by validations enforced by the ABAP language version 'ABAP for Key Users'. 

By leveraging these Fiori apps, business users can partake in innovation while keeping the core clean and thus ensuring it remains seemlessly upgradeable.
