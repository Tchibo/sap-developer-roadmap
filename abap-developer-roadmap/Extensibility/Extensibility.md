Extensibility enables SAP solutions to cater for diverse business needs while ensuring upgrade stability.

**Key user extensibility** empowers non-technical users to adapt SAP applications. Key user tools enable end-users to create fields, change UI elements, or adjust business rules according to business requirements without involving code changes.

**Developer extensibility** empowers ABAP developers to extend applications using SAP BTP Business Application Studio and ABAP Development Tools (ADT) for custom enhancements and extensions that surpass the options available to key user extensibility. 

**Side-by-side extensibility** integrates innovative external applications with the On Premise SAP system by means of tools provided in SAP BTP. With it ABAP developers can innovate outside of the SAP On Premise core and thus leave the core unaffected and seemlessly upgradeable.

**Classic extensibility** offers maximum flexibility with no restrictions for extensions in OnPremise Systems and was used therefore for a long time.  Still it can lead to serious challenges regarding upgrades and should therefore be avoided in favor of using developer extensibility options.
