Extensibility enables SAP solutions to address diverse business needs while ensuring upgrade stability.

**Key user extensibility** empowers non-technical users to adapt SAP applications. Key user tools enable end-users to create fields, change UI elements, or adjust business rules according to business requirements without involving code changes.

**Developer extensibility** empowers ABAP developers to extend applications using SAP BTP Business Application Studio and ABAP Development Tools (ADT). It enables custom enhancements and extensions that go beyond the options available with key user extensibility.

**Side-by-side extensibility** integrates innovative external applications with on-premise SAP systems by means of tools provided on SAP BTP. This approach allows ABAP developers to innovate outside of the on-premise SAP core and, keeping it unaffected and seamlessly upgradeable.

**Classic extensibility** offers maximum flexibility for extensions in on-premise systems and was historically the only available extensibility option. However, it can lead to significant challenges during upgrades and should therefore be avoided in favor of using developer and side-by-side extensibility approaches.
