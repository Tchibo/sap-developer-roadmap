In SAP, an enqueue lock is a mechanism that prevents multiple users or processes from changing the same data at the same time. It ensures data consistency by “locking” a specific record or table entry while one user is editing it (e.g. sales order). Key points:

• Lock Objects: Defined in the Data Dictionary, they specify which fields (for example, a customer number or purchase order) will be locked.  
• Enqueue "Server": A central SAP work process that manages all locks. When a user requests a lock, the enqueue server grants it if the data isn’t already locked; otherwise, the user must wait.  
• Lock Modes: Typically either exclusive (no one else can read or write) or shared (others can read but not write).  
• Duration: Locks are held only for the duration of a transaction. Once the transaction ends (commit or rollback), the lock is released automatically.

By using enqueue locks, SAP avoids conflicts and ensures that updates are applied correctly without overwriting or losing data.

For more information take a look at Lock Object in ABAP & Dictionary Data Types.

In managed RAP BO context the lock mechanism is handled by the managed RAP BO provider.
