> [!todo] Naming 'behaviour pool'
> - [ ] Here and in other sections of the RAP topic please use 'behaviour pool' instead of 'behaviour pool class'. The the behaviour implementation class is a 'class pool'. 
> 	- [ ] Switched to 'behavior class pool'. I'd like to mention 'class'.

The Behavior Definition Language (BDL) in SAPâ€™s RESTful Application Programming Model defines the runtime behavior of business objects declaratively. Any operation declared in BDL must also be implemented as a method in the associated ABAP behavior class pool. A single BDL file defines a whole business object, including its root entity and all child entities.
#### Types of Behavior

> [!todo] 'Operation types'
> - [ ] Making a field read-only or mandatory is static feature control, i.e. 'Making field read only or mandatory' could be used to explain list item 'Feature and authorization control'
> 	- [ ] Not sure what you intend here? Do you want me to create new text for 'Feature and authorization control'? 
> 	- [ ] Removed 'Making field read only or mandatory' 

RAP entities support different operation types:

- **Operations**: Basic CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) automatically handled by the framework in managed scenarios.
- **Draft operations**: Enable immediate storage of user input, managed automatically by the framework in managed scenarios.
- **Validations** and **Determinations**: Ensure data consistency within the RAP business object.
- **Actions**: Custom business operations specific to the entity.
- **Feature and authorization control** to enable or disable operations.
- Automatic **UUID generation** (`numbering : managed`) 
- Defining an **e-tag** for optimistic locking in draft creation
- Declaring **side effects** when a user input or action requires a related action to be triggered.


```BDL
