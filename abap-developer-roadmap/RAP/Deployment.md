> [!todo] Title of subtopic 'UI rendering' rather?
> Providing a UI for projected BO behaviours is important and hence needs more detail. Mention metadata extension and the importance of @UI annotations to control the Fiori Elements runtime and OData exposure in the service binding. And the fact that at Tchibo Fiori UIs are always deployed to the central BTP Launchpad using SAP Build Code, never to the On-Premise Frontend Server. 

In order to deploy a RAP application and add it to a Fiori launchpad, it requires a **Fiori Elements** application as a shell. The Fiori Elements project may be completely empty and only facilitate UI based on the RAP application. But it can also be used to extend the RAP application with Fiori features.
