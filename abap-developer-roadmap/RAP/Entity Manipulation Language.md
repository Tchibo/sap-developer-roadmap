SAP created Entity Manipulation Language (EML) as a SQL-like language to access RAP business objects from ABAP. EML ensures only allowed operations execute and required validations trigger. And it respects the hierarchical structure: child entities are manipulated via the root entity.
```
MODIFY ENTITIES OF R_SalesOrderTP
	ENTITY Order UPDATE FROM lt_orders_updated
	REPORTED FINAL(ls_reported) FAILED FINAL(ls_failed).
```

##### TYPES
RAP provides ABAP types for operations (read, create, update, delete) and message handling (reported, failed). These types are derived from the underlying CDS entities. They contain the entitiesâ€™ fields as well as generated RAP structures (for example, `%key` , which contains all key fields) to aid RAP operations.
Derived types can be defined in pool class definitions for reuse and as method parameters to modularize code.
```
DATA orders_updated TYPE TABLE FOR UPDATE R_SalesOrderTP\\Order.
```

##### Message and Error Handling
Each action implementation receives reported and failed structures. Use reported to send messages to users - they display automatically in the UI based on type (info, warning, error). Best practice is using MESSAGE INTO and filling reported from SY to maintain where-used functionality. But this requires custom implementation.

Fill failed when operations fail. This triggers automatic rollback to restore the last consistent state.
```
MESSAGE e041(message_class) INTO DATA(lv_message).
APPEND VALUE #(  %msg = 
	new_message_with_text( text     = lv_message
						   severity = if_abap_behv_message=>severity-error 
					      ) ) TO reported-Order.
```
