The **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model** is an ABAP framework for creating an end-to-end Fiori application including persistence, behavior and user interface. All functionalities are integrated into an extended OData service. The user interface is generated by Fiori elements based on UI annotations.
A RAP application therefore provides access to a **Business Object (BO)** with all required operations on the business data.
