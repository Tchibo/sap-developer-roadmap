In a landscape of various systems and possibly diverse UI technologies applications are best consumed through a central application launchpad where Single Sign On and unified rendering ensure a good user experience (UX). To this end, using the Site Manager of SAP Build Work Zone, applications based on ABAP Web Dynpro (WD4A), SAP Fiori or Web GUI are configured manually or federated for rendering in the central launchpad.

SAP Fiori applications can originate from various ABAP application servers in the system landscape (typically SAP Standard applications) or from the BTP HTML5 Application Repository Service (typically custom built applications). Fiori Applications consumed from the BTP HTML5 Application Repository Service can also stem from deployments using the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). 

WebGUI is a stop-gap UI technology that allows rendering of SAP GUI transactions in browsers. It enables consumption of SAP GUI UIs through the central launchpad and thus saves business users the UX disruption of leaving their web browsers when working in SAP.
