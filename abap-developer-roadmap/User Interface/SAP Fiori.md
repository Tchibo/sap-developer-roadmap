#Basic 

**SAP Fiori** applications use the **SAPUI5** JavaScript client library to render user interfaces as 'Single Page Applications' in the web browser. SAPUI5 based applications that respect the Fiori Design Guidelines are called SAP Fiori applications. Fiori applications are role based and show only content focused on that role.

SAPUI5 is a stateless, client side UI technology for rendering in web browsers. 'Stateless' refers to the fact that the application server does not keep track of the state of a user session between user interactions, 'client side' refers to the fact that UI components are processed in the web browser on the client device to render the UI. New backend services in an ABAP application server that provide data to Fiori applications are implemented using the RESTful application programming model (RAP). 

**Fiori Elements** describes the approach of using SAP Fiori template apps that are configured for UI rendering of custom built data models. Using configured Fiori Elements template apps removes the need to code UI behaviour and caters for metadata driven UI rendering based on data model annotations stemming from the backend. Fiori Elements template apps are available in various floorplans for different use cases. 

Based on SAP's UI roadmap we follow a 'Fiori First' UI strategy: new, custom built UIs are to be implemented as Fiori UIs unless a SAP GUI use case applies.
