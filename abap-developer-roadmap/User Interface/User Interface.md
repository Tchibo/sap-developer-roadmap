 As an ABAP Full Stack developer you have to make a call on how to render the application logic to the user community that should consume it. The SAP ABAP Platform technology stack has evolved in its long history of providing user interfaces (UI) for business applications. Some of those are 'thick' client-side UIs (additional application installed on the user's device, like SAP GUI), some are server-side UIs (created on the server and uploaded to the client for execution, like ABAP Web Dynpro) and some are 'thin' client-side UIs (downloaded library of JavaScript executables, run and cached in the browser, like SAPUI5).
 
 For compatibility reasons most of the UI rendering abilities that were provided with the ABAP Platform over time are still present today. The decision for a UI technology for a given use case is guided by Tchibo best practices regarding best UI fit for the purpose it needs to fulfill. In this topic the allowable user technologies to be used at Tchibo and their use cases is discussed. 

After considering the UI topics in this roadmap visit the 'UX Developer Roadmap' to advance your learning journey.
