SAP BTP Destinations are central configuration entries on the [[SAP BTP|SAP Business Technology Platform]] that define access to external systems or services. They contain all the necessary connection information such as URL, authentication method and proxy settings.

By using destinations, applications can access external resources without having to maintain connection data directly in the code. This simplifies maintenance, increases security and enables flexible use in different environments.
