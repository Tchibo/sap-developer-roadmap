> [!toDo] Kyma runtime not part of Tchibo (best) practice
> As such I would not mention it in the CAP developer roadmap as yet.


> [!quote] SAP Discovery Center
>SAP BTP, Kyma runtime is a fully managed Kubernetes runtime based on the open-source project "Kyma". This cloud-native solution allows the developers to extend SAP solutions with serverless Functions and combine them with containerized microservices. The offered functionality ensures smooth consumption of SAP and non-SAP applications, running workloads in a highly scalable environment, and building event- and API-based extensions.
