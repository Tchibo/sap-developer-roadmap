Role collections in [[SAP BTP|SAP Business Technology Platform]] are used to group multiple roles together, allowing for efficient and centralized assignment of permissions to users or user groups. Instead of assigning individual roles to each user, administrators can create a role collection containing all relevant roles and then assign the collection to users or groups. This approach simplifies user management and ensures consistent access rights across applications and services.

Role collections are typically managed in the [[SAP BTP Cockpit]], where administrators can add or remove roles from collections and assign these collections to the required users. Using role collections helps streamline the process of maintaining access controls as business requirements evolve.
