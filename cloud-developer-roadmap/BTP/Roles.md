Roles in [[SAP BTP|SAP Business Technology Platform]] are used to control access and enforce restrictions within applications and services. By assigning roles, you can specify which actions or features are available to different user groups. Roles can be granted to users directly or through role collections, allowing for flexible and fine-grained access management. This ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations or access restricted data within the application or service.

Roles are typically defined and managed in the [[SAP BTP Cockpit]], where administrators can assign them to users or groups according to business requirements.
