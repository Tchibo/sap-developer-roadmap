SAP Work Zone provides a modern digital workplace experience by combining applications, processes, information, and collaboration tools in a unified user interface on[[SAP BTP]]. It builds upon the capabilities of the [[SAP Fiori Launchpad]] service and extends them with advanced page composition, integration of third-party content, and collaboration features.

Once an [[SAP Capire]] project has been deployed to an [[SAP BTP Subaccount]], its user interfaces can be exposed in SAP Work Zone through the integration with the launchpad site. Administrators can define which user groups have access to the application and embed the UI into role-based workspaces, offering users a personalized and collaborative access point to their business applications.
