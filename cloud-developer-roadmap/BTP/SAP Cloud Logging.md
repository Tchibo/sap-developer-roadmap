The SAP Cloud Logging Service enables logs and metrics to be persisted and visually displayed in the form of dashboards. In addition, the service offers monitoring and alert functionalities and, for example, informs a target group about errors or similar issues based on user-defined rules.

Within an [[SAP Capire]] project, the SAP Cloud Logging Service can be added using the command `cds add cloud-logging`. This ensures that the necessary configurations are created so that the logs generated by `cds.log` automatically appear in the SAP Cloud Logging Service via ingest.
