> [!todo] SAP Build Workzone is the successor to SAP Portal Service
> The feature of including the CAP UI into a central launchpad is provided by SAP Build Workzone in the target architecture. The SAP Portal Service which Tchibo is using is an older version offering launchpad abilities. Tchibo is meant to migrate to SAP Build Workzone when the time is right (merging of spaces and pages delivered). So this article is duplicate content and I would omit this article.


The SAP Cloud Portal Service offers end users a central web entry point on [[SAP BTP]] to access business applications through the [[SAP Fiori Launchpad]] interface. Administrators can define the structure of applications, navigation, and branding while ensuring secure user management.

> Once an [[SAP Capire]] project has been deployed to an [[SAP Cloud Portal]], its user interfaces can be made available to end users through a launchpad in the SAP Cloud Portal. It is also possible to configure which user groups are allowed to access the application.
