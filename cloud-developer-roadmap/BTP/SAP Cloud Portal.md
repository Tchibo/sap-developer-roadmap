The SAP Cloud Portal Service offers end users a central web entry point on [[SAP BTP]] to access business applications through the [[SAP Fiori Launchpad]] interface. Administrators can define the structure of applications, navigation, and branding while ensuring secure user management.

> Once an [[SAP Capire]] project has been deployed to an [[SAP Cloud Portal]], its user interfaces can be made available to end users through a launchpad in the SAP Cloud Portal. It is also possible to configure which user groups are allowed to access the application.
