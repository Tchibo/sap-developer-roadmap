The SAP XSUAA is the central component for managing authentication and authorization in applications running on [[SAP BTP]] in the [[Cloud Foundry]] environment. It serves as an [[OAuth 2.0]]â€“compliant authorization server that issues JSON Web Tokens ([[JWT]]s) to ensure secure access to services. While XSUAA itself does not store user accounts, it delegates authentication to trusted identity providers such as the [[SAP Identity Authentication Service]] or corporate [[IdP]]s.

In [[SAP Capire]] applications, [[Roles|roles]] and [[Role-Collections|role-collections]] are defined in the `xs-security.json` file. This configuration includes the application name (`xsappname`), defined scopes and role templates. Developers deploy this configuration by creating an XSUAA service instance and binding it to the application. To authenticate users and handle routing, the [[App Router]] is required. SAP recommends using the [[Managed App Router]], which can be created directly from the MTA editor in [[SAP Build Code]]. This approach simplifies setup, reduces maintenance overhead, and ensures that security configurations such as XSUAA integration are managed consistently by the platform.
