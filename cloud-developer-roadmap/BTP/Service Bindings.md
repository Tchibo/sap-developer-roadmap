Service bindings in [[SAP BTP|SAP Business Technology Platform]] are secure connection mechanisms linking applications with the [[SAP BTP|BTP]] services they consume. They provide credentials and configuration so apps can connect to services without exposing sensitive data in code.

**Key aspects of [[Service Bindings]] in [[SAP BTP]]**
1. **Purpose**
   Deliver connection details (credentials, endpoints, certificates) for services like [[SAP HANA]], authentication, or messaging.
2. **Security**
   Store sensitive info securely, ensuring apps can access services safely.
3. **Creation**
   Created via the [[SAP BTP]] Cockpit, [[cf CLI]], or deployment manifests.
4. **Usage**
   Common for database connections, destination services, [[SAP API Management]], and [[SAP Event Mesh]].
5. **Technical Implementation**
   In [[Cloud Foundry]], bindings inject environment variables into app containers with all required connection data.
6. **Lifecycle Management**
   Can be created, updated, or deleted independently of services or apps.
  
Service bindings are essential for enabling secure, flexible, and maintainable connectivity in [[SAP BTP]] environments, ensuring applications can consume platform services efficiently.
