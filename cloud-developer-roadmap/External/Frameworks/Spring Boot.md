Spring Boot is a framework that builds on the Spring Framework and uses a preconfigured set of different Spring modules and additional third-party libraries to simplify the development of standalone applications and services.
The aim of Spring Boot is to make projects executable "out of the box" with minimal configuration effort. Thanks to a large number of automatic conventions, so-called "opinionated defaults", developers can quickly achieve productive results without having to deal with extensive XML- or Java-based configurations.

In addition, Spring Boot offers a selection of modules for aspects such as data modelling and data persistence, authentication and authorisation. With the help of Spring Security, Spring Data JPA and similar modules, complex business logic and data models can be mapped efficiently. This makes Spring Boot particularly attractive for microservice architectures and cloud-native applications, as it enables rapid development, simple maintenance and high scalability.
