> [!toDo] Not a current Tchibo BTP technology choice
> I don't think we would get a Tchibo CAP developer to choose Vue.js as his UI rendering framework, as opposed to SAPUI5. Hence I would consider not including an article about it in the roadmap.

Vue.js is a progressive [[JavaScript]] framework (with support for [[TypeScript]]) used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning developers can use it to enhance parts of an existing project or build fully-featured applications from scratch. Vue.js provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps developers efficiently structure and manage UI logic. Its core library focuses solely on the view layer, while additional features like routing and state management are available through officially maintained libraries.
