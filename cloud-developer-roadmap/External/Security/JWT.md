JSON Web Token (JWT) describes an open standard for the secure exchange of information between multiple participants in JSON format. The trustworthiness of the data contained can be validated by checking the signature, which is located in the third part of the token. For this reason, JWTs are particularly suitable for authenticating users within applications and services, as the token serves as digital proof of identity after login and can be sent to the server for further requests to enable access to secured resources.

A JWT is divided into three sections, which are separated from each other by dots: Header.Payload.Signature. The header contains metadata about the signature algorithm used, the payload stores the actual claims, like the transmitted information about the user or other entities, and the signature is generated by cryptographically signing the header and the payload using a secret key. This structure ensures that the recipient can check whether the transmitted information is unchanged and authentic.
