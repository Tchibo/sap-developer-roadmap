Version control is a system that tracks and documents changes to software code over time. It enables us to:
- Track all code changes (who, when, why)
- Allow multiple developers to work simultaneously on the same project
- Revert to previous versions when needed
- Use branching to develop new features without affecting the main codebase
- Merge different code branches

Common version control systems include [[Git]], with platforms such as [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]] and [[Bitbucket]].
