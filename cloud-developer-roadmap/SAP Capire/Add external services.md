The [[SAP Capire]] Framework allows you to integrate external services into your project, including SAP systems via the [[SAP Cloud Connector]] and third-party services like [[AWS S3 Object Store]] or external [[REST API]]s. This enables you to expose and implement these services within your application.

The official Capire documentation provides detailed guidance on connecting external services. For establishing connections, the [SAP Business Application Studio (BAS)](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/bas) is recommended, as it includes an [[HTTP proxy]] to resolve system destinations. The [[SAP Cloud SDK]] documentation also offers additional support.

**Summary**  
The [[SAP Capire]] Framework simplifies the integration of both SAP and third-party services, with comprehensive documentation to ensure seamless connectivity.
