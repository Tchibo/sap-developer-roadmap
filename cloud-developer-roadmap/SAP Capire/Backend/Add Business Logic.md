Implementing business logic in the [[SAP Capire]] Framework is achieved by defining custom handlers for your services. These custom handlers allow you to extend or override default service behavior with your own logic, such as validation, calculations, or complex processing steps. Additionally, you can integrate external services within these handlers, for example, by making  [[API]] calls or connecting to on-premise [[OData]] services, to enrich or process data as part of your application workflow.

**Summary**  
Custom handlers in the [[SAP Capire]] Framework enable you to implement tailored business logic and integrate external services into your cloud applications.
