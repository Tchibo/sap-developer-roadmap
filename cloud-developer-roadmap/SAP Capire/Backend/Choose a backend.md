> [!NOTE]
> The [[SAP Capire]] framework allows the choice between two backend technologies: [[Express.js]] (with [[Node.js]]) and [[Spring Boot]] (with [[CAP Java Backend]]). It is advisable to carefully consider which technology is best suited for the project before setting it up. Within Tchibo, the [[Node.js]] backend is preferred; therefore, the roadmap is focused on development with [[Node.js]]. 
>**It is important to note that the choice of backend technology does not affect the overall structure of the project.**
