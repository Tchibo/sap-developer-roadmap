> [!toDo] Not the CAP language choice at Tchibo at the moment
> Considering that SAPUI5 is a JavaScript/ TypeScript runtime and already requires ABAP developers to be proficient in it for SAP Fiori extensions I would recommend against promoting CAP Java. As quality of coding comes largely by experience managing a third language (ABAP, JavaScript/ TypeScript) is not helpful. I would hence not mention it as a separate topic.

**Backend Development with [[Java]]/[[Spring Boot]] in the SAP [[SAP Capire|CAP]] Framework**
The SAP [[SAP Capire|Cloud Application Programming]] Framework also supports **[[Java]]** as a runtime, based on **[[Spring Boot]]**. The [[Java]] implementation is particularly aimed at development teams that prefer enterprise-grade solutions and the established [[Spring Boot]] ecosystem.

**Typical [[SAP Capire|CAP]] applications with [[Java]] use:**
- **[[CDS]]** models, which are processed in [[Java]]
- **[[Spring Boot]]** as a proven framework for configuration, security, and deployment
- **[[SAP Java SDK]]s** for integration into SAP cloud environment

**Advantages of the Java runtime in [[SAP Capire|CAP]]:**
- **Enterprise-ready** with established [[Spring Boot]] concepts
- **Strong typing and excellent tool support**
- **Seamless integration** with existing Java enterprise systems
