**Backend Development with Node.js in the SAP [[CAP]] Framework**
The SAP [[SAP Capire|Cloud Application Programming]] Framework provides native support for [[Node.js]] as a runtime environment. Developers can quickly and efficiently build services, data models, and business logic using [[JavaScript]] or [[TypeScript]]. [[Node.js]] is seen as a preferred choice for rapid prototyping and productive cloud applications within the [[SAP Capire|CAP]] ecosystem.

**Typical [[SAP Capire|CAP]] applications with [[Node.js]] use:**
- **[[CDS]]** for modeling
- **[[Express.js]]** architecture (embedded in the [[SAP Capire|CAP]] Framework) for [[HTTP]] services
- **[[cds CLI|@sap/cds]]** [[NPM]] package to implement services

**Advantages of the [[Node.js]] runtime in [[SAP Capire|CAP]]:**
- **Quick start** thanks to [[JavaScript]]/[[TypeScript]]
- **High flexibility** when integrating services and [[API]]s
- **Optimized integration** with [[SAP BTP]] services like [[SAP HANA Cloud]], [[SAP Authentication Services]], and [[SAP Event Mesh]] (or [[SAP Advanced Event Mesh]] (or Non-SAP Event-Brokers))
