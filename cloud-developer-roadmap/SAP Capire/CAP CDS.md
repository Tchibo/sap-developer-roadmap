> [!toDo] The CDS topic deserves at least 200 words :-)
> The concept of 'Core Data Services' for a managed data model deserves an article. How the data model defines the persistency and the service definition models entity projections for a specific use case. How a CDS resource deployed to e.g. the database triggers creating or updating of a database schema, or update of the server serving up entities of the model through RESTful requests. La magie quoi :-)
