The [[SAP Capire]] framework allows developers to implement custom logging solutions that can be tailored to individual requirements. By default, it integrates with the widely used [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging library, which enables flexible and extensible logging configurations.

> [!NOTE]  
> At Tchibo, we use the SAP Cloud Logging Service to persist and provide access to our logs.
