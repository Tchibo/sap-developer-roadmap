Using the [[cds CLI]], you can deploy your current database schema along with the corresponding local data files from CSV files. You can define the deployment target as either a local [[SQLite]] database or an external database, such as the [[PostgreSQL]] database used in [[SAP Capire]] projects.

For detailed information about limitations and additional relevant considerations, it is recommended to consult the respective database documentation in the official SAP Capire documentation.
