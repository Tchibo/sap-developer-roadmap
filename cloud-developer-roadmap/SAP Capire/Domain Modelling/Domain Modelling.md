Domain Modelling in the SAP [[SAP Capire|Cloud Application Programming]] Framework refers to the creation of a conceptual data model that represents the business objects, their [[relationships]], and rules in your [[application domain]] and is responsible for the definition of [[persistent tables]].

In the [[SAP Capire|CAP]] context, this is typically implemented through [[Core Data Services]], which provides a declarative language for defining [[Domain Entites|entities]], [[Association|associations]], and services. The [[Domain Modelling|Domain Model]] forms the foundation of your application and abstracts the technical details of data storage.

The [[Domain Modelling|Domain Model]] serves as the single source of truth for your [[application logic]] and simplifies the maintenance and evolution of your systems.
