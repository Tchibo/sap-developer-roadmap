The [[SAP Capire|SAP Cloud Application Programming Model]] is a framework designed to simplify the development of cloud-native applications. It provides a domain-driven, declarative approach that allows developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure details. Key technologies in the framework include Core Data Services ([[CDS]]) for data modeling, [[Node.js]] and [[Java]] for application logic, and [[OData]] or [[REST APIs]] for service exposure. For persistence, [[SAP HANA]] or other supported databases can be used, while [[SAP Fiori]] and [[Fiori Elements]] provide a modern, responsive user interface.

By combining these technologies, [[SAP Capire]] enables the rapid creation of scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready cloud applications.
