The standard texts of a user interface based on  [[Fiori Elements]] can be customised. The customisation can either be general for the entire application or specific for certain entities. This makes it possible, for example, to display a specific message for all business partners when confirming a business partner. To do this, a localisation file must be stored in the manifest file of the app, which overwrites the desired standard texts.
