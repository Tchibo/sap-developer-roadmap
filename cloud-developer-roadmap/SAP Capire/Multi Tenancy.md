Multi-tenancy is an architectural principle where a single instance of a software application is designed to serve multiple tenants, with each tenant having its own isolated and secure data environment. Within the [[SAP Capire]] Framework, this means developers can create applications that efficiently cater to multiple clients or user groups by utilizing shared resources while keeping each tenant's data isolated.

**Additional information:**
- Multi-tenancy supports scalability and cost-effectiveness by allowing infrastructure to be shared among many users.
- Security and data isolation are crucial to ensure integrity between tenants.
