The SAP Capire Framework is a framework developed by SAP that is used to develop cloud-native projects. With the Capire framework, it is possible to develop the database, service (business logic) and the front end (UI) in one project and deploy them as a whole to the [[SAP BTP]].

SAP provides the so-called "[The CAP Cookbook](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/)" for the development of SAP Capire projects, which provides a guide on how best to implement a CAP project (in a structured sequence).
