The [[SAP Capire]] Framework allows developers to mock external services and provide local test data during development. This is especially useful for testing and development without needing real connections to external systems. To achieve this, developers can create CSV files containing mock data (as for [[Add local data]], [[Add local test data]]). These CSV files should be placed in the `srv/external/data` directory within the project.
