Side effects within [[SAP Capire]] are used to define dependencies between fields in or for a UI context. Side effects can be used to ensure that when a field is changed, related fields are updated or other dependent values are recalculated and displayed in the UI.
With the help of the `@Side.Effects` annotation, it is possible to achieve this functionality easily and without implementing your own application logic within [[Fiori Elements]] applications.
