> CAP provides out-of-the-box support for declaring and serving date-effective entities with application-controlled validity, in particular to serve as-of-now and time-travel queries.
> 
> Temporal data allows you to maintain information relating to past, present, and future application time. Built-in support for temporal data follows the general principle of CDS to capture intent with models while staying conceptual, concise, and comprehensive, and minimizing pollution by technical artifacts.
