Value helpers make it easier for users to enter data in applications based on [[Fiori]] and [[Fiori Elements]] by offering the user a guided selection of valid values. Instead of free text input, users can search for and select specific values. This prevents errors due to incorrect input and increases user-friendliness.

In the [[SAP Capire]], value helps are defined via [[CDS annotations]] such as `@Common.ValueList`. These can reference other entities and support both static and dynamic filters. In [[Fiori Elements]] applications, this results in automatically generated value help dialogues that can be easily integrated into the user interface.
