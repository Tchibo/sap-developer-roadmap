>I recommend to use the [`@SAP-samples/fiori-elements-feature-showcase`](https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-elements-feature-showcase) repository instead of creating of resources for these topics.


> [!toDo] Contextualize the meaning of the showcase app
> Clarify that the feature showcase app serves the invaluable purpose to observe annotations and their behaviour for UI rendering. Deploy the feature showcase app in CAP, hyperlink it and refer to it as developer inspiration to a satisfying Fiori Elements app outcome.
