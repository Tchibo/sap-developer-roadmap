In software development, writing and using tests is a common practice to ensure that changes to a software component do not introduce unexpected behavior and that the results generated by the program still match our expectations.
There are different types of tests, each designed to validate the software from a specific perspective and at different stages of execution. These tests help detect errors systematically and improve overall reliability.

The [[SAP Capire]] framework provides built-in capabilities to write and integrate such tests into the development process.
The following roadmaps offer useful short insights into testing in backend development:
