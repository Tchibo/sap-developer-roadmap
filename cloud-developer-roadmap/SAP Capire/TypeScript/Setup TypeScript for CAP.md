To enhance type safety in your implemented business logic, it is recommended to use [[TypeScript]]. With the use of [[cds-models]], entities, views, and types defined in your database and service layers are automatically generated. These can then be referenced directly in your business logic, ensuring consistency and reducing runtime errors.

Comprehensive documentation is provided, offering detailed instructions and guidance on how to integrate [[TypeScript]] into your project.

**Summary**  
Utilizing [[TypeScript]] in [[SAP Capire]] projects ensures greater type safety and consistency by allowing direct access to generated entities and types from the data model. [[SAP Capire]] offers thorough documentation to support this integration.
