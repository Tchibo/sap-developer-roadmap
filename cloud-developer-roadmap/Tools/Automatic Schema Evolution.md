The [[Automatic Schema Evolution]] is a tool provided by the [[cds CLI]] to apply and migrate the changes to database schemas (which were defined with SAP [[CAP CDS]] according to the [[CSN]]) to already existing databases in order to be able to make continuous changes to the data model without losing the data after each change.

>[!NOTE]
> In the documentation of the supported database types by the [[SAP Capire]] Framework contains information about [[Automatic Schema Evolution]] in the "Deployment" section of the respective database.
