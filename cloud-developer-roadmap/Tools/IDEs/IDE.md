For [[SAP Capire]] development, it is recommended to start with a simple [[Visual Studio Code]] setup. This approach allows developers to gradually explore and configure the tools and extensions themselves, fostering a deeper understanding of the [[SAP Capire|CAP]] workflow and the available development utilities. Key extensions include the [[CDS language support]], Node.js debugger, and Git integration, which together provide a solid foundation for building and testing CAP applications.

For developers who prefer a more streamlined approach, a preconfigured [[SAP Build Code]] workspace is also available. This environment comes with essential CAP tools and extensions preinstalled, enabling immediate productivity without manual setup. While this can accelerate initial development, using VS Code first provides more flexibility to develop personal preferences and a deeper understanding of the CAP toolchain.
