SAP Build Code is a web-based IDE for SAP solutions, providing tools to build, deploy, and manage applications. It offers a cloud development environment with support for [[JavaScript]], [[TypeScript]], [[Fiori]], and [[SAP Capire|CAP]]. The environment is extensible and integrates with SAP services.

Key features include the **Storyboard** for visual UI design and **[[Guided Development]]** with interactive tutorials. These tools help streamline the design process and onboard new developers.

SAP Build Code is accessed through the [[SAP BTP]]. A [[Visual Studio Code]] extension, [Remote Access for SAP Business Application Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOSS.app-studio-remote-access), allows connecting to your workspace from a local VS Code installation. This setup enhances productivity by providing flexible access to SAP's development resources.
