Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, cross-platform source code editor from [[Microsoft]]. It is lightweight, supports numerous languages via extensions and offers features such as intelligent code completion, integrated debugging and [[Git]] integration. It is available for [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]].

The [[SAP Business Application Studio]] is recommended for development with SAP [[SAP Capire|CAP]], but VS Code can also be used. The extension [SAP Business Application Studio toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOSS.app-studio-toolkit) is useful for this.

You can connect to a [[SAP Business Application Studio|SAP BAS]] workspace from a local VS Code installation using the [Remote Access for SAP Business Application Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOSS.app-studio-remote-access) extension.
