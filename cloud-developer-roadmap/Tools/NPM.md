The Node Package Manager (NPM) serves as the primary package manager for [[Node.js]] and provides developers with an easy-to-use and efficient way to integrate and manage external packages within their projects. The npm [[CLI]] simplifies the process of installing, updating, and removing packages, as well as publishing own packages to an NPM registry.

NPM is structured around three core components that work together to deliver a seamless development experience. The NPM **website** provides extensive documentation and allows developers to browse through the extensive collection of published packages. The CLI acts as the main interface for developers to interact with an NPM registry and manage local project dependencies. The registry serves as the central repository where all published packages are stored and made available for download and integration into other projects.
