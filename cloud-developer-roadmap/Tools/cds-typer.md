`cds-typer` is an open-source tool that generates [[TypeScript]] typings from Core Data Services ([[CDS]]) models. It is widely used in [[SAP Capire]] Framework projects to ensure type safety and alignment between [[CDS]]-defined data structures and [[TypeScript]] application code.

**Usage in [[SAP Capire]] Projects**  
By integrating `cds-typer` into your development workflow, you can automatically generate and update [[TypeScript]] definitions whenever your [[CDS]] models change. This process helps maintain consistency between your models and the [[TypeScript]] codebase, and supports better [[IDE]] features like autocompletion and static checking.

**Key Benefits**
- Automatic generation of [[TypeScript]] types from [[CDS]] models
- Reduces runtime errors by enforcing type consistency
- Improves developer productivity with enhanced tooling support
