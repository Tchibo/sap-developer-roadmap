The [[Cloud Foundry]] [[CLI]] (`cf` [[CLI]]) is a command-line interface for interacting with [[Cloud Foundry]] environments, enabling developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications efficiently.

Key features include application deployment using buildpacks, service management (creating, binding, and configuring databases or caches), application lifecycle management (start, stop, restage, scale), user and role administration, space and organization management, and extensibility through plugins.

For developers using [[SAP Build Code]], the `cf` [[CLI]] comes preinstalled, allowing immediate use without additional setup. The CLI can also be installed manually on [[Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] environments.
