> [!quote] *Cloud MTA Build Tool*
> The Cloud MTA Build Tool is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready multitarget application (MTA) archive `.mtar` file from the artifacts of an MTA project.

The MBT CLI ([[Multi-Target Application]] Build Tool CLI) is a command-line interface used to build and package deployment-ready MTA archives (`.mtar`) for cloud applications on [[SAP BTP]]. It automates the process of bundling application modules, configurations, and resources, ensuring consistent and efficient deployments.

Key features include MTA archive packaging, a modulacf CLIr build process for complex applications, centralized configuration management, automation to reduce errors, and seamless CI/CD integration.

For developers using [[SAP Build Code]], the MBT CLI comes preinstalled globally, allowing builds to be triggered directly from the terminal without additional setup.
