DevOps in the context of [[SAP Capire|CAP]] applications on [[SAP BTP]] with [[Cloud Foundry]] is about ensuring that applications are not only developed but also reliably operated in the cloud. While DevOps in general covers a wide range of practices, in our case we focus on observability. Logging plays the central role because it provides direct insight into the runtime behavior of [[SAP Capire|CAP]] services and applications. With the help of [[SAP Cloud Logging]] or custom loggers developers can trace events, identify issues and continuously improve the quality of their applications. This forms a simple but effective foundation for DevOps in [[Cloud Foundry]] environments.
