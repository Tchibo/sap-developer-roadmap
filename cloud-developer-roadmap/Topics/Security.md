Security is a central aspect of every application on [[SAP BTP]]. It ensures that only authorized users can access the application and that they can only see and work with data relevant to their role. This principle protects sensitive information and prevents misuse of system resources. In [[SAP Capire|CAP]] this can be achieved through [[Roles|roles]] and [[Role-Collections|role collections]] in combination with authorization checks in the application layer. With the help of [[CAP CDS|CDS]] annotations developers can implement row level authorizations that restrict data access down to individual records. This way the application enforces both secure entry and precise control of business data.
