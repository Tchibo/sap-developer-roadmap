#Basic 

When developing SAPUI5 apps, it is important to use APIs to connect and improve app features. Developers have the option to choose from native standard OData services, custom client-developed OData services, and fully native REST services based on the Open Data Protocol (OData). In this subtopic, a closer examination of these options is provided, discussing the various methods and alternatives available. The differences between OData V2 and V4 are also explained, offering insights into how each version affects data and services. The goal is to provide developers with the information needed to make informed choices in their SAPUI5 projects.
