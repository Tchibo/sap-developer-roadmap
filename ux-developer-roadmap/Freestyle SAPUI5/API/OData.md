>Anmerkung: Vielleicht können wir noch einen Hinweis auf die ABAP-Roadmap geben. In Conectivity kommt auch ein OData Teil vor.

#Advanced 

OData (**O**pen **Data** Protocol) is a web service standard used by SAP to facilitate data exchange between systems. It provides a uniform way to share, access, and modify data over common web protocols, like HTTP, supporting both **XML** and **JSON** formats. OData allows the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling developers to access data directly from SAP systems, which is crucial for building enterprise-level applications.

In SAP, OData is integral for **SAPUI5** applications, offering a streamlined method to connect front-end applications with back-end services. SAP Fiori utilizes OData services extensively to ensure smooth and dynamic interactions between the UI and data sources. The protocol is available in various versions, with V2 being widely adopted due to its compatibility with existing applications, while V4 introduces enhanced features such as improved data model structures and smarter functionalities.

OData supports operations like data retrieval, updates, and filtering, enabling developers to build sophisticated user interfaces that interact seamlessly with SAP's business data. By standardizing data interaction, OData enhances scalability and integration, positioning itself as a backbone for modern SAP environments.

For more information on OData and the subtopic topic of connectivity in SAP backend systems, please refer to the Connectivity Section in our ABAP Developer Roadmap.
