OData V2 and V4 offer distinctive features for SAPUI5 development, impacting application functionality and design. OData V2 remains widely used, providing smart control capabilities and metadata-driven UI enhancements, although it has constraints on complex data types and action flexibility. OData V4, an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 20802), introduces improved data model support, singleton functionality, and comprehensive filtering and action handling, catering to complex business requirements.

Smart controls in SAPUI5 simplify development by automatically interpreting OData metadata, with support primarily for OData V2 services. They persist user interface configurations, offering intuitive and responsive applications with minimal manual setup.

The shift towards OData V4 involves a revamped SAP Fiori elements framework, embracing new functionalities like 1:n filtering and robust draft mode for consistent data handling under erratic network conditions. Developers gain flexibility using a building block model, assembling custom designs from UI pieces while SAP’s RAP (ABAP) and CAP (Cloud) programming models facilitate backend mechanisms.

SAP continues supporting OData V2 amidst introducing functional innovations exclusively in V4 architecture, advised for new application development. OData V4’s open-source stack is freely accessible, integrating seamlessly into UI5.
