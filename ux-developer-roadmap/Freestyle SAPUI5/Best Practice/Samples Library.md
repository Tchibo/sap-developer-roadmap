#Basic 

The **Samples section** serves as a practical and interactive showcase of SAPUI5 controls and features. This section allows developers to explore UI elements, customize properties, and witness real-time results, offering a more efficient learning method than solely relying on documentation.

-  **Live Demos:** Experience working examples for various controls, such as `Button`, `Table`, `Dialog`, and `Chart` directly in your browser.

-  **Code Preview:** Access the XML, JavaScript, or JSON code behind each sample to gain insights into its technical makeup.

-  **Property Customization:** Adjust settings like `enabled` state, width, or data bindings to explore dynamic behavior of controls.

-  **API & Documentation Links:** Quickly access detailed technical information for further learning.

-  **Mobile/Desktop Responsiveness:** View how examples adapt to different screen sizes, showcasing responsive design.


The benefits of this section are manifold. It accelerates learning by encouraging developers to engage with UI controls interactively, which speeds up the process compared to traditional methods. Moreover, it enhances testing and debugging, enabling validation of control functionality before actual implementation, thereby minimizing potential errors. The pre-built code snippets available in this section facilitate faster development, while adherence to SAPâ€™s Fiori UX guidelines ensures a consistent and seamless user experience across applications.
