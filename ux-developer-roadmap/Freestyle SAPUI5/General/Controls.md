UI5 Web Components are versatile web elements that can be integrated into SAPUI5 applications to enhance user interfaces. These components offer advanced features and can be seamlessly used alongside traditional SAPUI5 controls. By adjusting project settings, such as the `ui5.yaml` file, and installing necessary extensions, developers can efficiently manage these components and their dependencies.

Examples of UI5 Web Controls:

-  **Button**: A control that allows users to perform actions through clicking. It's highly customizable and can be styled to fit various themes.

-  **List**: Ideal for presenting data in a structured manner. You can bind this component to a data model to dynamically display a list of items.

-  **Dialog**: Used to create modal dialogs and pop-ups that require user interaction or provide information.

-  **Input**: A flexible control for collecting user input, supporting various types of data entry like text and numbers.

These components are compatible with standard SAPUI5 properties and events, which means they can be integrated into applications without significant changes to existing setups. The use of data binding allows elements like lists or inputs to connect to data models, enhancing interactivity. Incorporating UI5 Web Components into SAPUI5 projects enriches applications with modern, flexible controls, improving user experience while maintaining consistency with traditional elements.
