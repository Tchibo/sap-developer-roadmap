SAPUI5 empowers dynamic web navigation by reacting to URL changes to display specific views. It supports runtime target additions for flexible routing via user or backend data and enables nested routing for complex applications. Efficient title management further enhances responsive navigation.

Examples of Routing Types:

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Offers control over view display based on browser hash changes.
- **Dynamic Targets**: Allows runtime additions for flexible routing, useful when routing data is unavailable at design time.
- **Routing Configuration**: Defines path patterns and targets, supporting various parameters for navigation flow.
- **Multiple Targets**: Promote modular design, allowing multiple targets per route for organized navigation.
- **Nested Components**: Facilitate scalable architecture with proper hash management to prevent conflicts.
- **Event and Integration**: Real-time navigation feedback with events like `RouteMatched`.
