Draft handling is a crucial concept in SAP Fiori, especially when dealing with complex data entry scenarios. It provides a mechanism for users to save their work-in-progress changes without committing them permanently. This allows users to pause data entry tasks and resume them later without losing any information. Drafts are typically stored on the backend and can be retrieved whenever needed.

In SAP Fiori, draft handling ensures the smooth propagation of user entries through the application lifecycle. It offers key functionalities like auto-saving, which reduces the risk of data loss due to session timeouts or accidental closures. Additionally, drafts can be shared among different users, facilitating collaborative workflows.

From a technical standpoint, draft handling involves creating a temporary copy of the business object that captures changes until the user decides to finalize and save them. It interfaces with OData services to manage draft state, employing a strategy known as draft management. Developers implement draft-enabled applications using patterns like "CRUD support with draft."

Understanding these draft management mechanisms is fundamental for creating robust, user-friendly SAP Fiori applications that enhance user productivity by offering flexibility and data consistency.
