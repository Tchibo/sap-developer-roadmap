#Basic 

Fiori elements provides a set of standardized, ready-to-use UI templates known as **floorplans**, designed to rapidly build SAP applications with a consistent and efficient user experience. Each floorplan is tailored to common business scenarios, ensuring a uniform appearance and behavior across applications, and reducing the need for custom UI coding.
### Key Floorplan Types
- **List Report:** Displays large datasets in a table format. Supports powerful filtering, sorting, and grouping.
- **Object Page:** Shows detailed information about a single object, often navigated to from the List Report.
- **Overview Page:** Aggregates data from multiple sources or apps, summarizing key information for easy access and action.
- **Analytical List Page:** Combines business analytics with transactional data, allowing users to analyze KPIs and switch between views.
- **Worklist:** Presents a list of items that typically require user action, supporting bulk processing and efficient workflows.
### Design Characteristics
- Floorplans are **optimized for device adaptability**, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- The templates enforce **consistent SAP Fiori design guidelines**, which helps deliver a unified look and workflow across different applications.
- Choice of floorplan is determined by the **business use case** (overview, analytics, processing tasks, or detailed object management).
- Floorplans are deeply integrated with **OData services**, with available features and capabilities sometimes differing depending on the OData version (V2 vs. V4).
