#Advanced 

**Developer adaptation** is undertaken in adaptation projects created with SAP Business Application Studio (BAS). Using SAP Fiori Tools developers can use the 'Flexible Programming Model' of Fiori Elements to implement UI changes at given extension points and controller extensions to change application appearance and behaviour. 

SAPUI5 supports two different approaches for extending apps. The latest and recommended approach is called [Controller Extension](https://ui5.sap.com/topic/21515f09c0324218bb705b27407f5d61 "Controller extensions allow you to add functionality to existing applications. They can be used for extensibility purposes, for example by a customer wishing to extend SAP-delivered applications, or as a reusable part that is added to the original application.") using adaptation projects. The old approach is called '[Component Configuration](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/c264d66d6e3c4104818bc52c174a000c)' and implemented in extension projects. Note that when creating a project using the 'Fiori Adaptation Project' template ('Create project from template') in BAS the app generator wizard will identify whether the underlying app is suitable for an adaptation project. If not, it will suggest to create an extension project instead.
