#Advanced 

Facilitated by SAPUI5 Flexibility SAP Standard Fiori Elements and free-style UI5 apps can be extended using UI Adaptation by key users at runtime (**key user adaptation**) or by developers at design time (**developer adaptation**). Developer adaptation provides a greater scope for change compared to key user adaptation.

Standard SAP Fiori apps typically cater for key user extensibility of fields and business logic using the 'Custom Fields' and 'Custom Logic' apps. Adding new fields in the virtual data model and adding those fields to Fiori UIs or changing backend business logic can be achieved using key user extensibility and are therefore not a reason to extend an app by means of a developer adaptation.
