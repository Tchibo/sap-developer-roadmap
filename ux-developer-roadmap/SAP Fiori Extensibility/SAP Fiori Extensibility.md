UI5 is the strategic framework to render user interfaces (UI) for SAP business logic. UIs built with UI5 that follow the Fiori Design Guidelines are called Fiori applications. When Fiori applications shipped by SAP do not fit business requirements then extensibility options provided by SAPUI5 Flexibility can be used to make changes to the UI delivered by SAP. 

One of the essential principles of SAPUI5 flexibility is to be 'non-intrusive'. Extensions are made separate from the original application logic, thus ensuring minimal disruption during future updates.
